I worked with Alex Yurkowski and Robert Wirthman on this project.  

This folder contains two subdirectories.  The build folder contains the csvs and scripts used to build the database.  createall.sh will build the database and load the appropriate data. 

The source directory contains all the necessary php files that make up the front end.
